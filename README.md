# Sui Voting App

A decentralized voting system built on the SUI blockchain, allowing users to create, manage, and vote on proposals using NFTs as proof of voting.

- Switch to **Testnet** and click **Faucet** to receive SUI balance.  
- Perform actions such as **create**, **remove**, **delist**, **activate**, and **voting proposals**.
